                        <p>2. About muypil<br/>
                            muypil is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about anything in a
                            variety of pricing formats and locations. The
                            actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. muypil is not a party to
                            the transaction, and it is not a seller or a
                            traditional auctioneer.</p>

                        <p>Any guidance we provide as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing, and
                            sourcing is solely informational and you may decide
                            to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through
                            various programs, muypil has no control over and
                            does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the
                            truth or accuracy of users&#39; content or listings;
                            the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a
                            buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction
                            or return an item.</p>

                        <p>3. Using muypil<br/>

                            application, except with the prior express
                            permission of muypil;<br/>

                            Sellers must meet muypil&#39;s minimum performance standards. Failure to meet these
                            standards may result in muypil charging you additional
                            fees, and/or limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading your seller account.</p>

                        <p>If we believe you are abusing muypil and/or our Services in any way, we may, in our sole
                            discretion and without limiting other remedies,
                            limit, suspend, or terminate your user account(s) and access to our Services, delay or
                            remove hosted content, remove any special status

                            eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or
                            legal steps to prevent you from using our Services.</p>

                        <p>If we believe you are violating our policies prohibiting Offers to buy or sell outside of
                            muypil, you may be subject to a range of actions,
                            including limits on your buying and selling privileges, restrictions on listings and account
                            features, suspension of your account,
                            application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement. If you
                            are a seller and you offer or reference your
                            contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or
                            selling outside of muypil, you may be liable to
                            pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item does not sell.</p>

                        <p>We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a substantial
                            period of time. Additionally, we reserve the right
                            to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone for any reason at our
                            discretion.</p>

                        <p>4. Policy Enforcement<br/>
                            When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user&#39;s performance history and
                            the specific circumstances in applying our
                            policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the
                            right thing for both buyers and sellers. The
                            foregoing does not limit or impair our right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of
                            our Services to anyone, or to terminate this
                            agreement with anyone, for any reason at our discretion.</p>

                        <p>5. Fees and Taxes<br/>
                            The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Selling fees pages. We may
                            change our seller fees from time to time by posting

                            temporary promotions or any changes that result
                            in the reduction of fees.</p>

                        <p>If you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made using
                            some or all of our Services, even if sales terms
                            are finalized or payment is made outside of muypil. In particular, if you offer or reference
                            your contact information or ask a buyer for
                            their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of muypil, you may be
                            liable to pay a final value fee applicable to

                            bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed
                            payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you
                            wish to dispute the information muypil reported
                            to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at muypil Inc.,

                            using our Services, we may collect such sales

                        <p>Seller fees don&#39;t purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on our Services. We may
                            display third-party advertisements (including links
                            and references thereto) or other content in any part of our Services, in our sole discretion
                            and without consent from, or payment, fee

                            When listing an item for sale on our Services, you agree to comply with muypil&#39;s Listing
                            policies and Selling practices policy and also
                            agree that:</p>

                        <p>You assume full responsibility for the item offered and the accuracy and content of the
                            listing,<br/>
                            Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or
                            up to 24 hours in some circumstances). muypil
                            can&#39;t guarantee exact listing duration,<br/>
                            Your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month, based on the listing
                            terms at the time, until all quantities sell or
                            the listing is ended by you or muypil, in its sole discretion,<br/>
                            The content you provide complies with all of our listing policies, including the Images and
                            text policy,<br/>
                            Content that violates any of muypil&#39;s policies may be modified, obfuscated or deleted at
                            muypil&#39;s sole discretion,<br/>
                            We may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove, or correct
                            information,<br/>
                            We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking for. Therefore,
                            the appearance or placement of listings in search
                            and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:<br/>
                            buyer&#39;s location, search query, browsing site, and history;<br/>
                            item&#39;s location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time,
                            history, and relevance to the user query;<br/>
                            seller&#39;s history, including listing practices, Detailed Seller Ratings, muypil policy
                            compliance, Feedback, and defect rate; and<br/>
                            number of listings matching the buyer&#39;s query,<br/>
                            To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse
                            results regardless of the sort order chosen by the
                            buyer,<br/>
                            Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on some of our Services,<br/>
                            muypil&#39;s Duplicate listings Policy may also affect whether your listing appears in
                            search results,<br/>
                            Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered so as to not
                            affect third-party search engine results,<br/>
                            We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings.
                            Such recommendations may be based on the
                            aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and current listings; results may
                            vary for individual listings. To drive the
                            recommendations experience, you agree that we may display the sales and performance history
                            of your individual listings to other
                            sellers,<br/>
                            For items listed in certain categories, subject to certain programs, and/or offered or sold
                            at certain price points, muypil may require the
                            use of certain payment methods, subject to our Payments methods policy. For example, for
                            inventory covered by authentication services, buyer
                            and sellers may be subject to escrow and/or payment handling requirements,<br/>
                            You will not sell and will promptly remove all listings for any product recalled by a
                            manufacturer or governmental agency if the sale of the
                            product is prohibited by law or regulation or the product poses a health or safety hazard as
                            specified by any governmental agency. muypil
                            has no responsibility or liability for the safety or performance of any product that you
                            list or sell through the Services, including any
                            product that is subject to a recall. You are solely responsible for any non-conformity or
                            defect in, or compliance with any public or
                            private recall of any product you list or sell through the Services.<br/>
                            7. Purchase Conditions<br/>
                            When buying an item on our Services, you agree to the Rules and policies for buyers and
                            that:</p>

                        <p>You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or committing to
                            buy,<br/>
                            You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an
                            item, your offer for an item is accepted, or if you
                            have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise accepted),<br/>
                            For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction
                            representing a buyer&#39;s serious expression of
                            interest in buying the seller&#39;s item and does not create a formal contract between the
                            buyer and the seller,<br/>
                            We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to you,<br/>
                            Utah Code Annotated &sect; 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code &sect; 2-401(2) apply to
                            the transfer of ownership between the buyer and
                            the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise.<br/>
                            8. International Buying and Selling; Translation<br/>
                            Many of our Services are accessible internationally. We may offer certain programs, tools,
                            and site experiences of particular interest to
                            international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and
                            international shipping calculation tools. Sellers and
                            buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the
                            international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.
                        </p>

                        <p>If you purchase an item on an muypil site that is different from your registration site, you
                            are subject to the User Agreement and applicable
                            policies of that other muypil site with respect to that particular purchase, as detailed in
                            the International Selling Policy.</p>

                        <p>For sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an muypil site other than
                            the site where you listed your item for sale,
                            based on your shipping settings. You may adjust these settings as detailed in the
                            International Selling Policy. If you list your items with
                            an international shipping option, the appearance of your listings on sites other than the
                            listing site is not guaranteed. If you sell an
                            item on an muypil site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to the
                            User Agreement and applicable policies,
                            including any buyer protection programs, of that other muypil site with respect to that
                            particular sale, as detailed in the International
                            Selling Policy.</p>

                        <p>You authorize us to use automated tools to translate your muypil content and member-to-member
                            communications, in whole or in part, into local
                            languages where such translation solutions are available. We may provide you with tools
                            which will enable you to translate content at your
                            request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.</p>

                        <p>One of the ways that we may make muypil.com listings available to international buyers on
                            muypil.com and on muypil&#39;s international sites
                            is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United States and
                            purchased by an international buyer through the
                            Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing
                            facility located in the United States after
                            receiving notification of payment from the buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global
                            shipping provider, will oversee the processing,
                            customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international
                            buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about

                            To protect muypil from risk of liability for your actions as a seller, muypil has at times
                            recommended, and may continue to recommend, that
                            PayPal restrict access to funds in a seller&#39;s PayPal account based on certain factors,
                            including, but not limited to, selling history,
                            seller performance, returns, riskiness of the listing category, transaction value, or the
                            filing of an muypil Money Back Guarantee case.
                            This may result in PayPal restricting funds in your PayPal account.</p>

                        <p>In connection with managed payments as described in Section 14, we may also restrict seller
                            access to funds based on the factors described in
                            the Payments Terms of Use.</p>

                            to any of those numbers and autodialed

                            User Privacy Notice. These service providers
                            may contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages, only as authorized
                            by muypil to carry out the purposes identified

                        <p>muypil may, without further notice or warning and in its discretion, monitor or record

                            own protection.</p>

                            its messages platform, including messages between

                            rules, and policies. This scanning and analysis may occur before, during, or after the
                            message is sent, or while in storage, and may result
                            in your message being delayed or withheld. muypil may store message contents, including to
                            conduct this scanning and analysis.</p>

                        <p>Privacy of Others; Marketing<br/>
                            If muypil provides you with information about another user, you agree you will use the
                            information only for the purposes that it is provided
                            to you. You may not disclose, sell, rent, or distribute a user&#39;s information to a third
                            party for purposes unrelated to our Services.

                            other means, unless you obtain the consent of the

                        <p>13. Additional Terms<br/>
                            Returns and Cancellations<br/>
                            Sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain
                            circumstances. For all new sellers, in listings where
                            returns are accepted, muypil will set a default rule that automates the return process.
                            Sellers may remove or customize their return
                            preferences in their account settings within My muypil. Where settings have been set to
                            automatically accept requests for returns or
                            replacements, an muypil-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You
                            agree to comply with our returns policy.</p>

                        <p>When an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize muypil to request
                            that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or
                            other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge
                            your payment method on file.</p>

                        <p>The cost of return shipping for an item that is not as described is the seller&#39;s
                            responsibility.</p>

                        <p>You (as seller) authorize muypil to place the return shipping label cost on your invoice,
                            subject to your automatic payment method on file
                            when:</p>

                        <p>An muypil-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its
                            cost;<br/>
                            Returns have been automated;<br/>
                            You fail to send your buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an muypil-generated
                            shipping label is used; and/or<br/>
                            A transaction is cancelled, and to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize muypil to
                            request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in
                            same or other currency) from your PayPal account. See canceling a transaction for more
                            details.<br/>
                            muypil Money Back Guarantee<br/>
                            Most muypil sales go smoothly, but if there&#39;s a problem with a purchase, the muypil
                            Money Back Guarantee helps buyers and sellers
                            communicate and resolve issues. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a
                            final decision on any muypil Money Back
                            Guarantee case.</p>

                        <p>If you (as seller), choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or
                            muypil under the muypil Money Back Guarantee, you
                            authorize muypil to request that PayPal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other
                            currency) from your PayPal account, place the
                            amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file. If we cannot get
                            reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding
                            sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.</p>

                        <p>We may suspend the muypil Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we
                            suspect abuse or interference with the proper working
                            of the policy.</p>

                        <p>14. Managed Payments<br/>
                            muypil has launched a new managed payments service, where a designated muypil entity (each,
                            a &quot;payments entity&quot;) manages payments
                            on behalf of sellers (such management described as &quot;managed payments&quot; or similar).
                            Some muypil sellers have already enrolled in
                            managed payments. muypil anticipates moving more seller accounts to managed payments in
                            phases starting in July 2020, providing notice to
                            the affected sellers as they are scheduled to be moved.</p>

                        <p>When we enable your account for managed payments, to continue to list and sell on muypil, as
                            directed by the payments entity, each
                            transitioned muypil seller registered in the US must:</p>

                        <p>provide the payments entity with information about you and/or your business to meet its
                            compliance requirements, including those involving
                            identity verification, anti-money laundering controls, and sanctions screening as required
                            by applicable laws and policies; and<br/>

                            payments entity, as determined by the payments
                            entity; and<br/>
                            provide bank account information for a U.S.-based checking account so that the payments
                            entity can link such checking account to your muypil
                            account, allowing the payments entity to pay you.<br/>
                            In addition:</p>

                        <p>the payments entity may obtain information about you from third-parties to verify your
                            identity, comply with anti-money laundering and
                            sanctions screening obligations, and for other purposes in connection with managed payments;
                            and<br/>
                            the payments entity may use third-party payments service providers to assist it in providing
                            managed payments services, including companies
                            that process payments, perform risk assessments (such as credit agencies) or compliance
                            checks, verify identity, and validate payment
                            methods. muypil, the payments entity, and their affiliates may send personal data associated
                            with you and your account to such
                            third-parties.<br/>
                            The payments entity may, in its sole discretion, manage payments on your behalf even if you
                            haven&#39;t provided all requested information,
                            and the payments entity may withhold payouts pending receipt of such information.</p>

                        <p>The complete terms governing sellers&#39; use of managed payments are available in the
                            Payments Terms of Use, incorporated herein. You agree
                            to the Payments Terms of Use to the extent applicable to you, whether or not your account
                            has been enabled for managed payments.</p>

                        <p>The contract for sale underlying the purchase of goods is directly concluded between seller
                            and the buyer in the same manner as for
                            transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments.</p>

                        <p>If you are a buyer completing a purchase from a seller that is using managed payments:</p>

                        <p>You may pay for such items using those payment methods that the payments entity makes
                            available, and the payments entity will manage
                            settlement to sellers. By completing purchases from sellers who use managed payments, buyers
                            authorize the payments entity to initiate
                            payments using the buyers&#39; selected payment method and collect the transaction amounts
                            on behalf of sellers. &nbsp;Accordingly, payments
                            received by the payments entity from buyers satisfy buyers&#39; obligations to pay sellers
                            in the amount of payments received.<br/>
                            In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason
                            including for suspected fraud, AML compliance,
                            compliance with economic or trade sanctions, in connection with muypil&#39;s internal risk
                            controls or due to potential violations of any
                            policy of muypil or the payments entity, or a policy of one of the payments entity&#39;s
                            third party payments services providers.<br/>
                            muypil, the payments entity or its affiliates may save payment information, such as credit
                            card or debit card numbers, and card expiration
                            dates, entered by you on our Services when you make a purchase, redeem a coupon, or make any
                            other transaction on our Services where card
                            information is entered. Such stored payment information may be used as your default payment
                            method for future transactions on our Services.
                            At any time, you can update your card information or enter new card information, at which
                            point the new card information shall be stored as
                            your default payment method. You may make changes to your default payment method through the
                            Personal Information section under the Account
                            tab in My muypil. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of information we have on
                            file, and you consent to muypil updating such
                            stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or
                            other payments services providers. You will only
                            provide information about payment methods that you are authorized to use.<br/>
                            You may seek returns or cancellations on our Services, or file muypil Money Back Guarantee
                            claims on our Services, in the same manner as you
                            do for transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments. The payments
                            entity refunds amounts paid for successful muypil
                            Money Back Guarantee claims and returned or cancelled transactions in cases where the
                            original payment was managed by the payments entity.
                            Refund timing may vary in accordance with the rules of third parties, such as credit and
                            debit card networks.<br/>
                            You agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable laws,
                            regulations, rules and terms and conditions in
                            connection with the use of managed payments. You understand that some third parties, such as
                            credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit
                            card networks and payments services providers, may have their own terms and conditions for
                            the payment or settlement methods you choose to
                            use in connection with managed payments transactions. Failure to abide by third party terms
                            and conditions may result in fees assessed to
                            you (for example, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the transaction
                            currency is different from your credit card
                            currency) or other actions taken by such third parties, and you agree that the payments
                            entity has no control over, or responsibility or
                            liability for, such fees or actions.<br/>

                            breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of our Services or your breach of any law
                            or the rights of a third party.</p>

                        <p>18. Legal Disputes<br/>
                            PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL
                            IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND muypil HAVE AGAINST EACH
                            OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</p>

                        <p>In this Legal Disputes Section, the term &ldquo;related third parties&rdquo; includes your
                            and muypil&rsquo;s respective affiliates,
                            subsidiaries, parent companies, predecessors, successors, assigns, as well as your, muypil&rsquo;s,
                            and these entities&rsquo; respective
                            employees and agents.</p>

                        <p>You and muypil agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may
                            arise, between you and muypil (or any related third
                            parties) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User
                            Agreement, your use of or access to the
                            Services, the actions of muypil or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased
                            through the Services, will be resolved in
                            accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.</p>

                        <p>A. Applicable Law<br/>
                            You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws
                            of the State of Utah, without regard to
                            principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute
                            that has arisen or may arise between you and
                            muypil, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.</p>

                        <p>B. Agreement to Arbitrate<br/>
                            You and muypil each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may
                            arise, between you and muypil (or any related third
                            parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User
                            Agreement, your use of or access to our Services,
                            the actions of muypil or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased
                            through our Services shall be resolved
                            exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.</p>

                        <p>Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and
                            so long as the matter remains in such court and
                            advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal
                            Arbitration Act (&quot;FAA&quot;), and to the extent not
                            inconsistent with the FAA, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of
                            conflict of laws, governs the interpretation and
                            enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>

                        <p>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<br/>
                            YOU AND muypil AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN
                            INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
                            IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
                            UNLESS BOTH YOU AND muypil AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
                            ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S OR PARTY&#39;S CLAIMS, AND
                            MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
                            CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO,
                            THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING
                            MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING
                            RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
                            PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&#39;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED
                            CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that
                            applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph&#39;s limitations as to a
                            particular claim or a particular request for a
                            remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request
                            (and only that claim or that remedy request) must
                            be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 18.C
                            below), subject to your and muypil&#39;s right to
                            appeal the court&#39;s decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>

                        <p>Arbitration Procedures<br/>
                            Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
                            instead of a judge or jury, and court review of
                            an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and
                            relief on an individualized basis that a court
                            can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a
                            court would. All issues are for the arbitrator
                            to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this
                            Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation
                            of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative
                            Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;),
                            shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>

                        <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;)
                            under its rules and procedures, including the
                            AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the
                            AAA&#39;s International Centre for Dispute
                            Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent
                            agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which
                            AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA&#39;s rules are available at www.adr.org and
                            www.icdr.org. In the event that the AAA is
                            unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the
                            parties or, if the parties cannot reach the
                            agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator.</p>

                        <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a
                            valid Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;),
                            which may be downloaded at this link. The Notice to muypil must be sent to muypil Inc.,
                            Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute,
                            583 W. muypil Way, Draper, UT 84020. muypil will send any Notice to you to the physical
                            address we have on file associated with your muypil
                            account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid,
                            you must personally sign the Notice and complete
                            all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the
                            claims you are asserting, the specific relief
                            sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.</p>

                        <p>If you and muypil are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days
                            after muypil receives that Notice, you or
                            muypil may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings
                            is available on the AAA&#39;s site at
                            www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and
                            procedures, the party initiating the arbitration
                            must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to muypil
                            at the following address: muypil, Inc. c/o CT
                            Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event muypil
                            initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a
                            copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your
                            muypil account. Any settlement offer made by you or
                            muypil shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>

                        <p>If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the
                            county in which you reside or at another
                            mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the
                            arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County,
                            Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or
                            counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be
                            resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to
                            require an in-person hearing, if the
                            circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or muypil may
                            attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator
                            requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.</p>

                        <p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law,
                            including recognized principles of equity, and will
                            honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
                            rulings in prior arbitrations involving different
                            users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same muypil user to the
                            extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&#39;s
                            award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                            entered in any court having jurisdiction
                            thereof.</p>

                        <p>Costs of Arbitration<br/>
                            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s
                            rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement
                            to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this
                            Agreement (&quot;Arbitration Procedures&quot;) and
                            the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, muypil will pay all
                            administration and arbitrator fees associated with
                            the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by muypil should be submitted by mail to
                            the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and
                            muypil will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA.
                            In the event the arbitrator determines the
                            claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse muypil for
                            all fees associated with the arbitration paid by
                            muypil on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA&#39;s
                            rules.</p>

                        <p>Severability<br/>
                            With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (&quot;Prohibition
                            of Class and Representative
                            Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), if an arbitrator or court decides that any
                            part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or
                            unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>
